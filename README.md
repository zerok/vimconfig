# vimconfig

This is my current VIM configuration organized using pathogen. Currently
included are following plugins:

* [ack][] is more or less a replacement for the :grep commands. I simply
  prefer ack over grep also outside of vim.
* [ctrlp][] replaces CommandT and MRU for me with the additional benefit of
  not having an Ruby dependencies. It definitely takes some time getting used to
  but for now I'm happy with it.
* [gundo][] is something I use extremly rarely, but whenever I need to work with
  undo-states in VIM, I wish I'd remember I had it installed ;-)
* [nerdtree][] is *the* file panel for VIM.
* [riv][] provides some awesome helpers for working with rST files like you find
  them in nearly every Python project nowadays.
* [scss-syntax][]
* [syntastic][] is a generic static code checker framework for VIM similar to
  something like SublimeLinter if you've worked with Sublime Text.
* [tabular][]
* [ultisnip][]
* [commentary][] is probably the single most useful plugin if you're coding
  because it makes commenting and uncommenting so much easier.
* [fugitive][]
* [golang][]
* [hybrid][] is currently my colorscheme of choice.
* [javascript-indent][]
* [javascript-syntax][]
* [json][]
* [markdown][]
